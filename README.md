## Overview

The forward converter is a type of DC-DC converter that utilizes a transformer to transfer energy from the input to the output. By integrating a buck converter topology, the system efficiently steps down voltage levels while providing electrical isolation. This project simulates the behavior of such a converter, analyzing its performance under various operating conditions.

## Project Objectives

- Develop a simulation model of a forward converter with a buck and transformer configuration.
- Analyze the converter's voltage and current waveforms to understand its operation.
- Evaluate the efficiency and performance metrics of the converter under different load conditions.
- Explore the impact of component variations on the overall system behavior.

## Design Methodology

- **Circuit Design**: Construct the schematic of the forward converter, selecting appropriate components such as inductors, capacitors, diodes, and switches.
- **Transformer Modeling**: Design the transformer with suitable turns ratio to achieve desired voltage levels, ensuring proper magnetic coupling and minimizing losses.
